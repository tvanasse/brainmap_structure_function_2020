## "Correspondence of functional co-activation and structural co-alteration brain networks: A transdiagnostic meta-analysis" by Vanasse et al.
# Code
(1) img_correlation_testing.ipynb is script testing correspondence between functional and structural components <br />
(2) entropy_calculation.ipynb is script calculating disease/behavior diversity of components <br /> 
(3) linear_model calculates linear model and cook's distance plot <br />

# Data
(1) data folder stores structural and functional images (also available at: http://anima.fz-juelich.de/studies/Vanasse_Fox_2019 ) <br />
(2) behavior and diease component loading at data/python_entropy_analysis <br />
(3) data/1000_iter_11-18.npy is output of noise simulation strategy <br />
